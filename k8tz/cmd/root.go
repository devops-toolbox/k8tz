or with an admission controller. 

Containers does not inherit timezones from host machines
and have only access to the clock from the kernel-space.
The default timezone for most images is UTC. With k8tz it
is easy to standardize selected timezone across pods and
namespaces automatically without any changes to their
deployments.
